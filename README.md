# COP2800 - Java Programming Final Project

## For this assignment, you will design a set of classes that work together to simulate a police officer issuing a parking ticket.

### The classes you should design are:

- The ParkedCar Class. This class should simulate a parked car. The class's responsibilities are: (i) To know the car's make, model, color, license number, and the number of minutes that the car has been parked.

- The ParkingMeter Class. This class should simulate a parking meter. The class's only responsibility is: (i) To know the number of minutes of parking time that has been purchased.

- The ParkingTicket Class. This class should simulate a parking ticket. The class's responsibilities are: (i) To report the make, model, color, and license number of the illegally parked car. (ii) To report the amount of the fine, which is $25 for the first hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked, plus $10 for every additional hour or part of an hour that the car is illegally parked. (iii) To report the name and badge number of the police officer issuing the ticket.

- The PoliceOfficer Class. This class should simulate a police officer inspecting parked cars. The class's responsibilities are: (i) To know the police officer's name and badge number. (ii) To examine a ParkedCar object and a ParkingMeter object, and determine whether the car's time has expired. (iii) To issue a parking ticket (generate a ParkingTicket object) if the car's time has expired.

## Write a program that demonstrates how these classes collaborate called ParkingTicketSimulator, which only consist of the main method.

### INSTRUCTIONS

### You are required to do the following:

1. Design a UML diagram showing the relationship between the classes above.
2. Create five classes (5) ParkedCar Class, ParkingMeter Class, ParkingTicket Class, PoliceOfficer Class, ParkingTicketSimulator Class with the requirements above in eclipse (preferred IDE). You classes MUST include constructors, accessors, mutators,copy and toString methods.
3. Sumbit your files (UML diagram and classes) in the dropbox above as a compressed folder named YourFirstName YourLastName.
